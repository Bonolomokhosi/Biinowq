    <h1>
WAKING UP WITH A HEAVY HEART
</h1>
<p>
Everybody wonder how do we manage to wake up everyday with a smile.The demons one have to face in the mist of each morning just to show the world that they are strong.Life has been too good to be true and too bad to be a dream,so now the question stands "What does it take to be alive?"
</p>
<h2>ACCEPTING LIFE THE WAY IT IS</h2>
<p>Being alive means making peace with whatever life throws at you,knowing that you can only change what is under your control and how we should react when coming across circumstances that are not under our control.Each morning when you wake up what do you usually do?Just rewind for some time and ask yourself whether that is worth it or not.Do you sometimes wonder why are you still alive?That you do everything in the bible yet you experience the worst?The reason I am asking so many questions is for you to reflect that your life matters.No matter the obstacles you come across.If your life was meaningless and had no purpose of living then I guess you wouldn't be alive.</p>
